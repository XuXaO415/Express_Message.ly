JSON Web Tokens
The JWT token itself is a string comprising three-parts:

Header: metadata abt token (signing algorithm used & type of token)
    It's returned as JSON
    ex:
    {
        "alg": "HS256",
        "typ": "JWT"
    }

Payload: data to be stored in token (typically an object)
    -Often this will store things like the user ID 
    -This is encoded, not encrypted - DO NOT STORE IMPORTANT INFO HERE!!
    ex:
    {
        "sub": "1234567890",
        "name": "John Doe",
        "permission": "Admin",
        "iat": 1516239022
    }

    Header and Payload are then encoded in Base64; just another way to express characters, storing txt. Transform into a single string.
 
Signature: version of header & payload, signed with secret key 
    -Uses algorithm specified in header
    -Verifies the origin of sender
